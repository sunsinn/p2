#### Description

The XKCD-style password generator creates a password that is easy to remember and difficult to guess 
from randomly chosen English words. The user is able to choose the number of words (between 4 and 12), 
the type of spacing between words (hyphen, space, or camelCase), and whether to add a number, a symbol, 
and/or a capital letter. It uses an array built from a csv list of the 4000 most common English words.
